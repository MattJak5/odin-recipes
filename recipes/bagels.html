                    <li>Mix 120ml of water in with the sugar and yeast. let them sit for 5 minutes before stiring to dissolve the ingredients.
                    <li>Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the middle and pour in the yeast mixture from step 1.</li>
                    <li>Pour 80ml of the warm water into the well. Start mixing together adding the remaining 100ml of water as needed, until the dough is moist and firm</li> 
                    <li>Knead the dough on a floured work surface for 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. At this point the dough should be firm and stiff.</li>
                    <li>Brush a large bowl with a thin layer of oil and turn the dough to coat. Cover the bowl with damp towel. Let rise for 1 hour in a warm place (or until it has doubled in size). Punch the dough down and leave for another 10 minutes.</li>

                    <li>Once shaped, place the bagels on a baking sheet covered with greaseprrof paper. Cover with a damp towel and leave to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220ÂºC and bring a large pot of water to the boil.</li>
                    <li>Once the water has boiled, reduce the heat and use a slotted spoon to add the bagels to the water. Boil for 1 - 2 minutes then flip over and boil for another 1 - 2 minutes.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The longer the boil, the chewier the bagel!</li>
                            <li><em>Adding sugar/maple syrup/bicarbonate of soda into the water before boiling will give the crust a nice brown colour, and in the case of bicarb a subtle pretzel-like flavour</em></li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Once boiled you can add additional toppings like <em>sesame seeds or poppy seeds.</em> Then place them on a greaseprrof paper lined baking sheet</li>
                    <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Cool on a wire rack before cutting in and topping</li>
